# DIY Split-Flap Display

This is a fork of scottbez1's project to create a Split Flap display. 
My attempt is to create a display that is simpler, sacrificing some functionality/correctness in order to create a tutorial that anyone can follow, even if they have no prior knowledge on the area. 
Since I'm a Software Engineer, I'm focusing on having an attractive software and a very simple hardware design.
If you know something about industrial design/electronics, I encourage you to take a look at https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap
in order to develop a more professional display, and contribute with your ideas.

### I'm currently working on updating the documentation with details on how to build it, and I will load the controller code shortly.

This is a work in progress DIY [split-flap display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display).

### Current Status ###

In progress!

## How to build: Instructions ##
This design is still a work in progress; a build log/instructions for building a prototype split-flap display of your own is posted in [the wiki](https://github.com/fpagliar/splitflap/wiki).
